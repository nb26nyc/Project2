what are 2D arrays:
    2D arrays are collection of 1D arrays. That we can use to store the data in the form
    of rows and columns just like we have in excel files in the form of tables
    on webpages.
Syntax:
    Approach 1:
    data types [][] variableName= new data types[size of rows][size of columns];
    Approach 2:
    data types [][] variableName={{ element 1,element 2,element 3},
                                    {element 4,element 5,element 6}
                                    };
